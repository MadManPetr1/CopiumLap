You peaked in Silver and still think it’s your team’s fault.
You deal less damage than your support’s coin.
Auto-filled? Nah, you’re just always bad.
You spend more time typing than last-hitting.
The only thing you carry is emotional baggage.
Enemy Jhin hits more crits than you hit CS.
They say ADC is weak, but you make it look unplayable.
Your ‘power spike’ is when you finally buy a control ward.
You flash forward and then ping support. Classic.
Lane phase ends, your existence ends.
You couldn't out-damage a cannon minion.
The fountain is your favorite turret.
Your KDA is a horror story.
You play like you paid Riot to lose.
