Remember: Even pro ADCs get camped. Suffer with pride.
Vayne was useless… until that one late teamfight. Stay delusional.
Today you lost LP, but gained mental fortitude. Maybe.
If Tyler1 can hit Challenger, you can hit Plat. Probably.
True ADCs mute all at champ select.
It’s not inting if you call it ‘limit testing’.
Every 0/8/0 ADC was once a 0/7/0 ADC.
Every support is a leash. Cut them and farm alone.
You’re only one pentakill away from relevance.
If the jungler won’t gank, solo-kill both lanes.
You only need one good game for a highlight montage.
You may be 0/6, but at least you're not autofilled jungle.
A true ADC learns nothing and queues again.
